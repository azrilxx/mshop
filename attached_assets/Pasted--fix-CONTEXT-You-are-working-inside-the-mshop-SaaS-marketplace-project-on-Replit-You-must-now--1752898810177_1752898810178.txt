# CONTEXT
You are working inside the `mshop` SaaS marketplace project on Replit. You must now replicate critical Alibaba UI patterns: login modal, registration page, and homepage search functionality. Use Alibaba.com as the reference.

You must activate Replit’s **agentic reasoning and MCP (Model Context Protocol)** to visually and structurally confirm what the target UI looks like before coding.

---

# MCP VERIFICATION (REQUIRED)
- Activate Replit’s agentic / MCP visual memory
- Locate the target layout patterns from Alibaba.com for:
  - Login modal UX
  - Supplier registration form
  - Landing search bar
- Confirm element spacing, form hierarchy, and button interaction
- Align placement, flow, and text fidelity with Alibaba standard

---

# FEATURES TO BUILD

## 1. UNIFIED LOGIN MODAL (Alibaba-style)
- Trigger from top nav "Sign In"
- Modal should include:
  - Email + password
  - Social login (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn) — stub buttons
  - Terms agreement line (with hyperlink)
  - Section list below:
    - My Muvex, Orders, Messages, RFQs, Favorites, Account, Membership

File: `components/LoginModal.tsx`

## 2. SIGNUP FORM (Supplier-style)
- Route: `/register/page.tsx`
- Fields (match Alibaba layout):
  - Country (auto-detected or default to Malaysia)
  - Trade Role: Buyer / Seller / Both (radio group)
  - Email, Password, Confirm Password
  - Company Name
  - Full Name (first + last)
  - Phone: prefixed country code + number
- Add checkbox to agree to terms
- Save to `user:{id}` in Replit DB:
```ts
role, companyName, phone, fullName, country, registeredAt
```

## 3. LANDING SEARCH HEADER
- Modify `/landing/page.tsx` hero section
- Add wide search bar component
  - White background, left-aligned text input
  - Orange submit button labeled “Search”
  - Optional icon on right (camera button, disabled)
  - Route to `/shop?query=...`
- Optional: show search tags under the bar

---

# DATABASE
Use Replit DB only. Store form output under `user:{id}`.  
Do not mutate existing cart/session behavior.

---

# VALIDATION
- Login modal layout matches Alibaba (visually and structurally)
- Signup form includes all required fields
- Search bar behaves as expected with proper layout
- MCP layout validation passes before rendering

---

# RETURN
