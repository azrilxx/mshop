# CONTEXT
You are working inside the `mshop` SaaS marketplace project on Replit. The marketplace is targeted at oil & gas B2B users. Sellers can already list products. Now, we must enable a complete buyer experience layer. This is Phase 8 of the deployment plan.

# GOAL
Build a full conversion funnel for buyers. Allow RFQ submission, buyer registration, seller contact, and quote visibility. All features must use Replit DB and respect existing auth + role logic.

---

# FEATURES TO BUILD

## 1. RFQ SUBMISSION FLOW
- Route: `/quote/[productId]/page.tsx` already exists
- Extend form to include:
  - Full name, company, email, quantity, delivery region, message
- Save RFQ under key: `rfq:{productId}:{rfqId}`
- Model:
```ts
{
  id: string;
  buyerId: string | null;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  quantity: number;
  region: string;
  message: string;
  submittedAt: ISOString;
}

2. BUYER REGISTRATION FUNNEL

    During registration or after login, show a setup step:

        "What are you sourcing?"

        Region / budget / urgency

    Store under: user:{id}.sourcingPreferences

3. SELLER NOTIFICATIONS

    When RFQ is submitted:

        If seller has WhatsApp set, open wa.me/ link on client

        If email exists, send message using existing notification-service

    Include product name, buyer info, and message in notification

4. BUYER DASHBOARD (Lite)

    Route: /dashboard/buyer

    Display:

        RFQs submitted

        Responses (static for now)

        Bookmarked products (use user:{id}.bookmarks: string[])

    Add “Save for later” button on each product card

5. TALK TO SELLER

    On product detail page:

        If seller has whatsappNumber, show “Chat on WhatsApp”

        If seller has email, show mailto: link

    UI must appear only for logged-out or buyer-role users

6. PRODUCT RECOMMENDATIONS

    Add tags: string[] to product model if missing

    On each product page, show:

        “You Might Also Like” section

        Pull products with at least 1 tag match

    Limit: 4 recommendations

7. SPEC SHEET DISPLAY

    Allow sellers to upload PDF spec sheets during listing

        Field: specSheetUrl: string

    On product page:

        If exists, show "Download Spec Sheet" or embed PDF viewer

DATABASE

Use Replit DB only. No Supabase.
All RFQs must be private to seller and admin.
Only buyers can submit RFQs.
VERIFICATION

    Confirm notifications are only sent to seller owner

    Confirm landing to RFQ experience works without error
