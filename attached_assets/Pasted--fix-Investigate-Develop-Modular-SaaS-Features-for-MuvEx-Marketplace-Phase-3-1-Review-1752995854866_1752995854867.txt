# Investigate & Develop Modular SaaS Features for MuvEx Marketplace (Phase 3)

1. **Review and Audit Existing Codebase**
   - Deeply audit current modules: Seller Center, Buyer Journey, Product/Cart/Order/Finance/Reports flows.
   - Ensure all database tables are in Supabase, remove leftover dummy/static data or image dependencies.

2. **Implement Plan-Based Feature Gating**
   - Set up three subscription plans: Free, Standard, Premium.
   - For each plan, define and enforce access rules for:
     - Number of active product listings
     - Commission rates
     - Feature access (ads, marketing, analytics, shipment, mass order tools, etc.)
   - Gate all seller-side and buyer-side features accordingly (use clear UI state and tooltips).
   - UI must clearly indicate locked/upgrade-only features for each plan.

3. **Activate & Integrate Ads, Engagement, and Shipment Modules**
   - Complete ads module (banner, featured listings, campaign management) with admin approval workflow.
   - Implement abandoned cart tracking and notification logic (backend + basic email trigger).
   - Add product ratings and comments modules, enforcing moderation and admin controls.
   - Build shipment management: vendor-defined shipping rules, order status tracking, mass/bulk shipment UI for sellers.

4. **Admin Controls: Merchant and Category Management**
   - Finish admin UI for merchant verification (approve/reject/ban, view KYC docs, etc.).
   - Enable admin category controls: add/edit/delete categories, set featured/priority, approve new category requests from sellers.
   - Add simple performance dashboard for admin (total users, merchants, pending approvals, reports).

5. **Refactor All Relevant UI/UX**
   - Modularize all new logic as React/Tailwind components.
   - Ensure seamless integration into both Seller Center and Admin Panel.
   - UI/UX must follow patterns from Shopee/Alibaba Seller Center (tabbed navigation, status badges, inline notifications, clean responsive layout).

6. **Testing & Validation**
   - Seed database with demo merchants and products for each plan type.
   - Write test flows for plan upgrade/downgrade, locked feature scenarios, admin approval cycles, and notification triggers.
   - Ensure all new features work both desktop and mobile-first.

7. **Documentation**
   - Update README and system documentation to reflect all new plan-gated features and admin controls.
   - Document all API endpoints, data models, and integration points for further devs.
