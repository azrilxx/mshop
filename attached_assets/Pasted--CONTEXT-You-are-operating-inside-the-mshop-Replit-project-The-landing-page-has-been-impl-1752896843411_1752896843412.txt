# CONTEXT
You are operating inside the `mshop` Replit project. The landing page (`/`) has been implemented using Tailwind and Replit DB. The current issue is the data layer: it is using empty or placeholder content.

Your task is to scrape real-world oil & gas product listings and category names from public sources, store the output into Replit DB, and dynamically render them into the landing page.

---

# SCRAPING DIRECTIVE

Use Replit's built-in `fetch()` and any accessible API or public HTML to extract real data.  
Preferred sources:
- alibaba.com
- made-in-china.com
- energydais.com
- globalspec.com
- offshore-technology.com

You must:
- Extract product name, image URL, price (if shown), region, tags or specs
- Extract or define category name that matches our B2B scope
- Limit scrape to 10–15 items total

If source blocks bots or has CORS issues, fallback to static JSON import temporarily — but still store result into Replit DB.

# DATA SCHEMA (REPLIT DB)

## Keys: `product:{id}`

```ts
{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number | null;
  imageUrl: string;
  region: string | null;
  tags: string[];
  category: string;
}

Keys: category:{slug}

{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  imageUrl: string;
}

INTEGRATION

    Use lib/landingDb.ts to expose:

        getAllCategories()

        getFeaturedProducts()

    Seed DB only if keys do not exist

    Dynamically hydrate /landing/page.tsx with this live data

UI RENDERING (EXISTING)

    Show “Shop by Category” grid with real scraped categories and images

    Show “Featured Products” from scraped content

    Ensure images are displayed using correct URLs

    Do not reference local assets or fake data

    All layout must remain Alibaba-style, mobile responsive

CONSTRAINTS

    Do not use Supabase

    Do not mutate other application routes

    Do not block Replit DB with unnecessary keys

    Do not over-fetch or violate robots.txt

RETURN

Output must include:

    Number of products and categories scraped

    Sample Replit DB keys and data stored

    Confirmation that landing page is now hydrated with real content
