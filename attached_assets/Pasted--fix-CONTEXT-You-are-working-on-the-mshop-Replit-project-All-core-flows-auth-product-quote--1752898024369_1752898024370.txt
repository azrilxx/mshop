# CONTEXT
You are working on the `mshop` Replit project. All core flows (auth, product, quote, billing, dashboard, landing) are live. This phase activates full admin governance, moderation, and control logic.

---

# OBJECTIVE
Build tools for platform governance. Admins must be able to verify sellers, review products, handle abuse reports, and control categories.

---

# FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT

## 1. SELLER VERIFICATION WORKFLOW
- Add boolean field to seller profile: `is_verified: boolean`
- In `/admin/merchants/page.tsx`, show:
  - All unverified sellers
  - Buttons: [Verify] / [Reject]
  - On Verify: set `is_verified = true`
  - On Reject: optional reason, then remove listing
- Mark verified sellers with a green badge across the site

---

## 2. REPORT ABUSE SYSTEM
- Allow buyers to report products:
  - Button: “Report Listing” on product page
  - Form: category, description, optional contact
  - Save to Replit DB: `report:{productId}:{id}`
- Admin route: `/admin/reports/page.tsx`
  - View product reports
  - Button: [Mark Reviewed] or [Suspend Listing]

---

## 3. CATEGORY MANAGEMENT
- Admin route: `/admin/categories/page.tsx`
- Load all current categories from `category:*`
- Ability to:
  - Add new categories
  - Edit existing names and image URLs
  - Archive categories (add `archived = true`)
- Archived categories must not show up in product creation or search

---

## 4. USER ACCOUNT CONTROL
- Route: `/admin/users/page.tsx`
- For each user:
  - View role, email, login date
  - Button: [Suspend Account]
- Add field to user: `status: "active" | "suspended"`
- On suspended, block login and hide user listings

---

## 5. AUDIT METRICS
- Reuse `/admin/metrics`
- Add:
  - Verified vs unverified sellers count
  - Products under review
  - Reports pending
  - Active vs suspended users

---

# DATABASE
Use Replit DB only.  
Use existing keys like `user:{id}`, `product:{id}`, `report:{productId}:{reportId}`.

---

# VALIDATION
- Only admin users can access admin pages
- Ensure field changes (verification, suspension) are reflected platform-wide
- Validate that abuse reports persist
- Ensure archived categories are hidden from buyer/seller views

---

# RETURN
- List of all new routes or components
- DB shape changes (e.g., status fields)
- Confirmation that admin panel reflects real-time platform state
