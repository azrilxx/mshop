# CONTEXT
You are working inside the `mshop` project on Replit. The system is production-ready and all major phases are complete. You will now implement a set of optional improvements to strengthen RFQ management, tagging UX, inventory logic, admin tools, and asset handling.

---

# OBJECTIVE
Add operational improvements to enhance quote tracking, inventory awareness, tagging experience, asset structure, and admin visibility.

---

# FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT

## 1. RFQ STATUS TRACKING
- Extend RFQ model in Replit DB:
```ts
status: "submitted" | "viewed" | "responded" | "archived"
```
- Update seller dashboard (where RFQs are viewed):
  - On open: mark RFQ as `viewed`
  - Add dropdown or buttons to manually mark RFQ as `responded` or `archived`
- Optional: use color badges for status display

---

## 2. INVENTORY CONTROL
- Extend product model:
```ts
stock: number | null
```
- Add input field during product creation/edit:
  - If left blank, stock = unlimited
- Display stock remaining on product card and detail page

---

## 3. ADMIN DASHBOARD METRICS
- Route: `/admin/metrics`
- Show:
  - Total buyers
  - Total sellers
  - Total products
  - Total RFQs submitted
- Use Replit DB key counts only (no charts needed)

---

## 4. TAGGING AUTOCOMPLETE
- Create `lib/constants/tags.ts`:
```ts
export const POPULAR_TAGS = [
  "Nickel Alloy", "Rental", "Sour Gas", "Inspection", "Valve", "CRA", "Geothermal", "Subsea", "Storage", "Welding"
]
```
- In `TagInput.tsx`, add dropdown suggestion when typing based on this array
- Filter options by partial match

---

## 5. PUBLIC ASSET NORMALIZATION
- Move all landing images used in categories or products to `/public/assets/`
- If images are currently in `/attached_assets/`, reassign image URLs to `/assets/filename.jpg`
- Do not break existing render paths in the landing page or cards

---

# VALIDATION
- Confirm that RFQ status updates persist in DB
- Confirm stock field is optional but respected during display
- Confirm admin metric counts load with DB latency fallback
- Confirm tag suggestion dropdown does not allow unsafe input
- Confirm no broken image links after public asset re-routing

---

# RETURN
- List of files changed
- Keys added to DB
- Any defaults set (e.g. stock = null, status = "submitted")
- Screens or components created or updated
