# OGX SaaS MVP - Master Execution Prompt for Claude

## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW

You are building **OGX**, a modular B2B marketplace platform similar to Shopee/Lazada but designed for business-to-business transactions. This is **Stage 1: MVP Development** targeting deployment on Replit with future migration to shop.muvonenergy.com.

);
```

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE products ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE orders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE order_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE carts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Profiles policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON profiles FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON profiles FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Products policies
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view active products" ON products FOR SELECT USING (status = 'active');
CREATE POLICY "Sellers can manage own products" ON products FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = merchant_id);

-- Orders policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own orders" ON orders FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = buyer_id OR auth.uid() = seller_id);
CREATE POLICY "Buyers can create orders" ON orders FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = buyer_id);

-- Cart policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own cart" ON carts FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = buyer_id);
```
